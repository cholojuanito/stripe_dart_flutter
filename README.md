# Stripe Dart

Stripe API (version 2016-07-06) implemented in dart.

Most of the model class documentations have been taken from the
[stripe documentation](https://stripe.com/docs).

This implementation is based on the official Stripe Java and NodeJS API wrappers
and written as a proper native dart library.


## Usage

```dart
import "package:stripe/stripe.dart";

main() async {

  var cardCreation =  CardCreation()
      ..number = '123123123';

  var customerCreation =  CustomerCreation()
      ..description = 'Customer for test@example.com'
      ..card = card;
      
  var customer = await customerCreation.create();

}
```

## Tests

The majority of the tests rely on connecting to a real Stripe Account in
testmode.
Therefore all tests expect your API **Test** Secret Key as the first script
argument and your account must be set to **US**. Testcoverage is limited (some
tests would require livemode and or OAuth).
